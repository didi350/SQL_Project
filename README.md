# Welcome!

This is an SQL project about an online movie rental shop, its customers and revenue (the payments made).\
The code includes questions and answers, using a variety of SQL keywords. There is also an extra insight called "Finding Susan" showcasing some critical thinking skills.
The project was created using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4.

This repository also contains code for loading the database, under the folder "load_database_pagila-master" with its corresponding licence, Copyright (c) Devrim Gündüz <https://www.gunduz.org/>. This can be used to double-check the results.

Thanks for coming around!
