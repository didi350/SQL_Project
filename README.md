# Welcome!

This is an SQL project about an online movie rental shop, its customers and the payments they made.\
There are several questions answered, each using a different set of SQL keywords. There is also an extra insight called "Finding Susan" showcasing some critical thinking skills.

The repository contains the project code, as well as code for loading the database, which can be used to check the results.

The projects were created using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4.

The code to load the database was licenced by Copyright (c) Devrim Gündüz <https://www.gunduz.org/>.

Thanks for coming around!
