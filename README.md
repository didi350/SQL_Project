# Welcome!

This is an SQL project about an online movie rental shop, its customers and revenue (the payments made).\
The project code is within the SQL_Code file. There are multiple questions in comments, and code to answer them using a variety of SQL keywords. There's also a bonus insight called "Finding Susan" which showcases some critical thinking skills, as well as reasoning explaining why certain joins are used over others.

The project was created using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4.

This repository also contains the code for loading the database, licenced with Copyright (c) Devrim Gündüz <https://www.gunduz.org/>. This can be used to double-check the results.

Thanks for coming around!
